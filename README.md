# Python Higher-Lower Game

## Description

The Python Higher-Lower Game is a simple and entertaining game project created during the 14th day of the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) challenge. This game allows you to compare the follower counts of two randomly selected items and guess which one has more followers. Your goal is to accumulate the highest score possible by making correct guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the Python script.
2. You'll be presented with two items to compare.
3. For each item, you'll see its name, description, and country of origin.
4. You need to guess which of the two items has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B' (without quotes).
5. If your guess is correct, your score will increase by 1.
6. The game continues, and new items are displayed for comparison.
7. If you make an incorrect guess, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.

The game is simple yet addictive. Challenge yourself to see how high of a score you can achieve!

## Code Overview

- The game is coded in Python and uses data from the `data.py` file.
- It randomly selects two items from the data and asks you to choose which one has more followers.
